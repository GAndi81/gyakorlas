        // strict mode

        /*The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 (ECMAScript version 5).

        It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

        The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

        With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

        Strict mode is supported in:
        IE from version 10. Firefox from version 4.
        Chrome from version 13. Safari from version 5.1.
        Opera from version 12.

        Declaration: "use strict"; vagy function strict()/notStrict()

        Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.

        // cookies

        Cookies let you store user information in web pages.
        Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.

        When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.

        Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

        When a user visits a web page, his name can be stored in a cookie.
        Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his name.


        Creation/ Deletion: 
        document.cookie = "username=John Doe"; 

        // a piece of text file which is saved into the users computer - each browser has a different cookpie type, those can't be seen by one another
        // technical data and text file based on domain
        // 3rd party cookies - those are created by other sites as owners of the content of diff img, adds
        // 1st party cookies - this is created by the site I visited

        // miért? megjegyzi az adataidat, emlékszik Rád, relevant infót küld,  

        // Delete, clear all cookies, Delete specific cookies - from a site, for a period of time
